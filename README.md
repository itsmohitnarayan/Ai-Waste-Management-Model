## Introduction
Effective waste management is crucial for maintaining environmental sustainability. The Ai-Waste-Management-Model aims to provide an intelligent solution for predicting waste conditions using sensor data. This model can be integrated into existing waste management systems to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is stored in `dataset.csv`. It contains sensor data and corresponding waste conditions. The data is preprocessed to encode labels and normalize features before being used for training.

## Model Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. It includes the following components:
- Input Layer: Accepts sensor data.
- LSTM Layer: Processes sequential data.
- Dense Layers: Perform classification.

The model architecture can be modified to use GRU or Bidirectional LSTM layers as needed.

## Training Process
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is trained using the training set with early stopping to prevent overfitting. The training process includes:
- Data normalization
- Model compilation with Adam optimizer
- Model fitting with early stopping

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the test set. Key metrics include accuracy and loss. The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's predictive capabilities.

## Results
The model achieves a high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting waste conditions. The training and validation accuracy are plotted to visualize the model's performance over epochs.

## Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure the dataset is available in `dataset.csv`.
2. Run `main.py` to train and evaluate the model.
3. The trained model is saved as `waste_management_model.keras`.
